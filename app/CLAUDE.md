# /app (Role 1: Mobile app, owner Mihai)

Expo (React Native, TypeScript), Expo Router, expo-camera for photos and barcodes. Must run in Expo Go on Android and iOS. English UI.

## Scope

Screens: login, today's log (macro totals vs targets), meal scan (photo or text) → editable ingredient list (change grams, remove, add) with live recalculation → save, barcode scanner, label review (ask the user to fill in fields the label endpoint couldn't read), product library, recipes, history.

- Talk only to Supabase and the AI service, never to Gemini, FDC or Open Food Facts directly.
- Call the AI service over HTTPS with the user's Supabase access token. Use the types in `contracts/ts/api.ts`.
- Barcodes go through the Supabase Edge Function `barcode-lookup`.
- Resize photos before upload (Gemini free-tier limits).
- Build against the deployed FastAPI stubs and Supabase seed data until real endpoints are live (see `docs/STATUS.md`).
- Recalculate macros with `contracts/ts/macros.ts`. Don't write your own.
- Show per-item confidence. Offer common portions (1 egg, 1 slice) and the top-3 alternative matches.

## May not touch

`/supabase`, `/ai`, `/eval`, `/contracts`.

## Commands

Add run, test and lint commands here once the Expo project is scaffolded.
