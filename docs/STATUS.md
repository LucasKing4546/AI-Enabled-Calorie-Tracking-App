# Status

Update this when you merge. Paste it into your Claude session at the start of each work block.
Newest entries first. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD · role · landed / contract change / blocked`.

## Phase 0 checklist (26 Oct–1 Nov)

- [x] Monorepo with `/app`, `/supabase`, `/ai`, `/eval`, `/contracts`, `/docs`
- [x] Root `CLAUDE.md` and one per folder
- [ ] DB schema, AI output JSON schemas and `openapi.yaml` agreed and merged
- [ ] FastAPI stubs returning fixed JSON deployed; DB seed data
- [ ] CI and branch protection on
- [ ] Everyone runs the app on their phone against the stubs

## Decided (24 Oct)

- Expo + Supabase (EU) + Python FastAPI AI service
- Roles: Mihai (1, app), Kevin (2, backend), Sebi (3, meal AI), Lucas (4, label AI & nutrition)
- Gemini Flash via the free Gemini API (AI Studio key), chosen over self-hosting
- Test on Android and iOS; English UI; Romanian and English labels

## Still open

- [ ] A1–A5: dates and what each asks for, to pin the phases
- [ ] iOS: who has an iPhone to test with Expo Go?
- [ ] FastAPI hosting: Render free tier, Railway, or a university server?
- [ ] Romanian dishes not in FDC: closest generic match or a small custom food table? (after first meal-photo tests)
- [ ] Who creates the GitHub repo and owns the Supabase project (suggested: Kevin)?
- [ ] One shared Gemini key on the backend, or one per developer for testing?
- [ ] Day and time of the weekly integration call
