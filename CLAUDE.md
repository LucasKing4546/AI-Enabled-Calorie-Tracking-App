# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Product

AI calorie and macro tracking app, built by a 4-person team where each person works in their own Claude session. The sessions can't see each other, so **the repo is the only shared memory**: contracts in `/contracts`, progress in `docs/STATUS.md`.

Core flow: user photographs a meal (or types it, scans a barcode, or photographs a nutrition label) → AI returns an **editable ingredient list** (name, grams, confidence, per-100 g macros) → user edits grams with live recalculation → saves the meal.

English UI. Labels in Romanian and English must be readable. Tested on Android and iOS.

## Session start

1. Read this file, then the `CLAUDE.md` in the folder you're working in, then everything in `/contracts`.
2. Read `docs/STATUS.md` for what has landed, what changed in a contract and what's blocked.
3. Work only in your own folders (see ownership below). If a contract needs to change, **stop and write a short proposal** for the user to raise with the team. Don't edit `/contracts` yourself.

## Stack (decided 24 Oct)

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Mobile app | Expo (React Native, TypeScript), Expo Router, expo-camera for photos and barcodes. Runs in Expo Go |
| Backend | Supabase: Postgres, Auth, Storage, RLS, **EU region**. `barcode-lookup` is a Supabase Edge Function |
| AI service | Python FastAPI on a free host (TBD). Checks the user's Supabase access token on **every** request |
| Models | **Gemini Flash** via the free Gemini API (Google AI Studio key) for meal photos, meal text and labels. No separate OCR library, no self-hosted models |
| Nutrition data | USDA FoodData Central (generic foods), Open Food Facts (barcodes) |
| Evaluation | Python notebooks in `/eval` |

**Gemini free tier:** Google may use prompts to improve its products. Test with your own photos only, never other people's data, and check the EEA terms before any real users. Stay inside free-tier limits: daily scan cap per user, resize photos before upload, cache results.

## Architecture

```
Mobile app (/app) ──data, auth──> Supabase (/supabase) ── barcode-lookup ──> Open Food Facts
       │
       └──HTTPS + Supabase access token──> FastAPI AI service (/ai)
                           ├─ meal      ──> Gemini
                           │    └─ calls nutrition to match foods
                           ├─ nutrition ──> FoodData Central
                           └─ label     ──> Gemini
```

- The app **only** talks to Supabase and the AI service, never to an external API directly. The Gemini key lives on the server, never in the app.
- Meal AI turns detected foods into database entries by calling the nutrition module, not FDC directly.
- AI service endpoints: `POST /meal/photo`, `POST /meal/text`, `POST /label/read`, `GET /foods/search`. Everything else is plain Supabase table access under RLS.

## Ownership

| Role | Person | Folders | Delivers |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Mobile app | Mihai | `/app` | Every screen: login, today's log, meal scan + editable ingredient list, barcode scanner, label review, product library, recipes, history |
| 2. Backend & data | Kevin | `/supabase/migrations`, `/supabase/functions/barcode-lookup`, `/supabase/functions/_shared`, repo and CI | Schema, RLS, storage, Auth, barcode lookup, meal saving, rate limits, account deletion, seed data |
| 3. Meal AI | Sebi | `/ai/app/meal`, `/ai/tests/meal`, `/eval/meal` | Photo and text → editable ingredient list matched to food entries; meal test set and accuracy numbers |
| 4. Label AI & nutrition | Lucas | `/ai/app/label`, `/ai/app/nutrition`, `/contracts/ts/macros.ts`, `/eval/label` | FastAPI service skeleton, auth check and deploy; label photo → per-100 g and per-serving values with checks; FDC food search; the shared macro calculator; label test set |

Nobody edits another person's folders without a PR that person reviews. Shared by everyone: README, course reports A1–A5, testing your own part end to end in the app. Each person's detailed task list is in their own copy of the team plan, not in this repo.

## Contracts (`/contracts`)

Single source of truth. Code against these files, not against what you assume a teammate built.

- `contracts/db/`: SQL migrations (tables: `profiles`, `foods`, `products`, `recipes`, `recipe_items`, `meals`, `meal_items`, `scans`)
- `contracts/ai/`: JSON schemas for AI output
- `contracts/openapi.yaml`: the AI service spec. TypeScript types are **generated** from it into `contracts/ts/api.ts`; don't hand-edit that file
- `contracts/ts/`: shared TypeScript types and `macros.ts`

**Ingredient item** (both meal endpoints return a list of these):
```json
{ "name": "scrambled eggs", "food_id": "fdc:173424", "grams": 120, "confidence": 0.72,
  "per_100g": { "kcal": 148, "protein": 10.0, "carbs": 1.6, "fat": 11.0 } }
```
`food_id` is prefixed by source: `fdc`, `off`, `label`, `manual`. `POST /label/read` returns `per_100g`, `per_serving`, `serving_grams`, and a list of fields it couldn't read.

**Macro rule:** macros = `per_100g × grams / 100`. The app recalculates on every edit; the server stores a snapshot at save (`meal_items`). This lives in **one function, `contracts/ts/macros.ts`**, that everything uses. Don't reimplement it.

**Label sanity check:** kcal ≈ 4·protein + 4·carbs + 9·fat.

## Mocks first

Nobody waits on anyone. In week 1 the AI service is deployed as FastAPI stubs returning fixed sample JSON that matches `/contracts/ai`, and the database gets seed data. The app builds against those; real endpoints replace the stubs in Phase 2.

## Git workflow

- `main` is protected and always passes CI.
- Branches: `<role>/<feature>`, e.g. `app/meal-edit-screen`, `ai/label-ocr`.
- Every PR needs one teammate's review. **A PR touching `/contracts` needs all four.**
- CI on every PR: lint, type-check, unit tests, a check that the FastAPI OpenAPI output matches `contracts/openapi.yaml`, and a type-check of the app against `/contracts/ts`.
- Merge every 2–3 days; rebase on `main` before opening a PR.
- After merging, tell the user what to add to `docs/STATUS.md` (what landed, contract changes, blockers).
- Secrets (Gemini key, Supabase service key) go in git-ignored `.env` files, with a committed `.env.example` beside each one.

## Privacy

Food photos and eating habits are personal data: RLS on every table, private storage buckets, `scans` rows (raw AI output + user correction) only with user consent, and full account + data deletion.

## Phases

Final demo in the week of 11 Jan 2027; 21 Dec–4 Jan is a light holiday break. Move dates once the A1–A5 deadlines are pinned.

0. Kickoff, 26 Oct–1 Nov: repo, CLAUDE.md files, contracts, stubs, CI. **Gate: contracts merged.**
1. Build in parallel, 2–29 Nov, against stubs and seed data. **Gate: real endpoints live.**
2. Integrate, 30 Nov–20 Dec: swap stubs for real ones. **Gate: demo on one phone.**
3. Evaluate & polish, 5–15 Jan: accuracy numbers, privacy, demo, report.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
